INSTALL_LOG: "If you save Ansible output to a log, you expose any secret data in your Ansible output, such as passwords and user names. By default Ansible sends output about plays, tasks, and module arguments to your screen (STDOUT) on the control node. If you want to capture Ansible output in a log, you have three options. Visit docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/logging.html for more details."
